I study seismogenic structures offshore and onshore Taiwan to better understand the Taiwan orogeny and improve seismic hazard assessments.

My current research focuses on earthquake source characteristics in both subduction zones and intraplate settings, with an emphasis on the western boundary of the Philippine Sea Plate. These studies aim to shed light on earthquake nucleation and triggering processes.

Outside of research, I enjoy watching movies, listening to film soundtracks, and practicing traditional health-preserving exercises.
