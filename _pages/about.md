My research focuses on understanding seismogenic structures and earthquake processes in and around Taiwan, with the goals of contributing to a broader understanding of lithospheric dynamics and improving seismic hazard assessments. I analyze seismic waveforms, relocate earthquakes, and determine focal mechanisms, in conjunction with velocity structure imaging.

Outside of research, I enjoy watching movies, listening to film soundtracks, and practicing traditional health-preserving exercises.
