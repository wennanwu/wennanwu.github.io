Seismogenic Structure Studies
======
The Significance of Seismogenic Structure Studies
+ Seismogenic structures, encompassing active and blind faults, are subsurface geological features where tectonic stress accumulates and releases, generating earthquakes.
+ Research into these structures is vital for understanding earthquake mechanisms, stress dynamics, and rupture processes. This understanding is crucial for characterizing potential future seismic events, including their location, depth, magnitude, and recurrence.
+ Investigating seismogenic structures enables rigorous seismic hazard assessment and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Furthermore, studying their behavior aids in identifying potential earthquake precursors, thereby enhancing early warning systems.
+ Beyond disaster mitigation, the study of seismogenic structures advances fundamental Earth science understanding of internal structure, plate tectonics, and crustal deformation.

Based on relocatted seismicity and focal mechanisms, we delineated the seismogenic structures from onshore to offshore SW Taiwan.
