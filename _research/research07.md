Seismogenic Structure Studies
======
Seismogenic structures, encompassing active and blind faults, are subsurface geological features where tectonic stress accumulates and releases, generating earthquakes.  

The Significance of Seismogenic Structure Studies:
+ Research into these structures is vital for understanding earthquake mechanisms, stress dynamics, and rupture processes. This understanding is crucial for characterizing potential future seismic events, including their location, depth, magnitude, and recurrence.
+ Investigating seismogenic structures enables rigorous seismic hazard assessment and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Furthermore, studying their behavior aids in identifying potential earthquake precursors, thereby enhancing early warning systems.
+ Beyond disaster mitigation, the study of seismogenic structures advances fundamental Earth science understanding of internal structure, plate tectonics, and crustal deformation.

Based on relocatted seismicity and focal mechanisms, we delineated the seismogenic structures from onshore to offshore SW Taiwan.

Crustal Stress Field Studies Based on Focal Mechanism Solution Inversion
======
Focal mechanism solutions, which describe fault motion during earthquakes, directly indicate the stress state at the seismic source. Based on numerous focal mechanisms, researchers can invert for and infer the orientation and relative magnitudes of principal stresses within a given region.

The Significance of Crustal Stress Field Studies: 

+ Focal mechanism solutions, which describe fault motion during earthquakes, directly indicate the stress state at the seismic source. By analyzing numerous focal mechanisms, researchers can invert for and infer the orientation and relative magnitudes of principal stresses within a given region.
+ This research is crucial for understanding regional tectonic stress fields, revealing stress distribution, concentration zones, and spatio-temporal variations, which provides fundamental insights into regional deformation and dynamics. It is vital for evaluating fault activity and seismic potential by assessing stress states on faults and identifying those prone to rupture, essential for seismic hazard assessment and active fault studies.
+ Furthermore, inverting co-seismic and post-seismic stress changes helps explain earthquake sequences and stress triggering. Variations in the stress field also offer potential physical constraints for earthquake prediction and early warning research, linking anomalous changes to earthquake nucleation processes.
